NEVER86

What is NEVER86?

NEVER86 is my brainchild that stemmed from a passion to 
solve the restaurant industries issues of organization,
stress management, and food waste. Restaurants are the
leading contributer to food being thrown out. I feel,
that with the proper data, and analytics, restaurants 
can minimize the amount of food that never gets eaten. 

my mission is to create a platform that allows servers to
thrive in the restaurant indusrtry, taking pressure off 
their shoulders, and making it easier to flow as a team.

RELATIONSHIPS

a restaurant has a manager, it has a menu, it has Servers, Tables

A table HAS a server, is IN a section and contains an Order

a server HAS tables, has a Section, 

an Order contains itemS, a total, a timestamp, and a server

when the server selects a table, it will create an order and give it to table

3 main pages to create first

1. New table page allows server to pick tables in their Section, only able to select if there is no order
2. current tables, will grab all tables in the servers section, and determine which ones are active

managers will be able to assign sections and choose a server to asisgn it to
